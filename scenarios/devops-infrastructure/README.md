# DevOps Infrastructure Scenario

Resources for infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment automation.

## When to Use This Scenario

- Writing Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi)
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps)
- Container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Cloud platform configuration (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Deployment automation and scripting
- Monitoring and observability setup

## Contents

### Claude Code
- **instructions.md** - Custom instructions for DevOps and infrastructure work
- **commands/** - Slash commands for common DevOps tasks

### Prompts
- IaC code review and best practices
- Pipeline optimization
- Security and compliance checks
- Deployment strategy design

### GitHub Copilot
- **instructions.md** - Context instructions for infrastructure projects

## Key Concepts Covered

- Infrastructure as Code principles
- CI/CD pipeline design
- Container and Kubernetes patterns
- Security best practices (secrets management, least privilege)
- Monitoring and logging strategies
- Disaster recovery and backup
- Cost optimization

## Usage Tips

1. Version control all infrastructure code
2. Use modules/reusable components for IaC
3. Implement proper secrets management
4. Test infrastructure changes in non-production first
5. Monitor and alert on critical metrics
