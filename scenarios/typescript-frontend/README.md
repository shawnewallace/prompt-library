# TypeScript Frontend Scenario

Resources for modern frontend development with TypeScript and JavaScript frameworks.

## When to Use This Scenario

- Building React, Vue, or Angular applications
- Working with TypeScript for type-safe frontend code
- Component-based architecture
- State management (Redux, Zustand, Pinia, etc.)
- Frontend testing (Jest, Vitest, Testing Library)
- API integration and data fetching

## Key Concepts Covered

- TypeScript best practices and advanced types
- Component composition patterns
- React hooks and lifecycle
- State management patterns
- Accessibility (a11y) standards
- Performance optimization (memoization, lazy loading, code splitting)
- Testing (unit, integration, e2e)

## Usage Tips

1. Leverage TypeScript's type system for safer code
2. Keep components small and focused
3. Write tests alongside component development
4. Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG)
5. Optimize bundle size and performance
